```

### 5.4 Connect to Google Calendar

1. Click **"Save and Connect with Google"**

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Redirect URI Mismatch"

**Problem:** The redirect URI doesn't match what's configured in Google Cloud Console.

**Solution:**
1. Go back to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
3. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. Under **"Authorized redirect URIs"**, verify the URI **exactly matches** the one shown in WordPress plugin settings
5. Common issues:
   - Missing `https://`
   - Wrong domain
   - Extra/missing trailing slash
   - Typo in the path

### Error: "Access Blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**Problem:** OAuth consent screen not properly configured.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**
2. Verify your domain is listed under **"Authorized domains"**
3. Ensure your email is correct
4. If using "External" user type, add your email to **"Test users"**

### Error: "The app is blocked from accessing Google Calendar"

**Problem:** App is in testing mode and you're not a test user, or the app is blocked.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **OAuth consent screen**
2. Click **"+ ADD USERS"** under Test users
3. Add your Google account email
4. Try connecting again

### Error: "Calendar API has not been enabled"

**Problem:** The Google Calendar API isn't enabled for your project.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Library**
2. Search for "Google Calendar API"
3. Click **"ENABLE"**

### Error: "Invalid Client" or "Client Secret Mismatch"

**Problem:** Client ID or Secret was entered incorrectly.

**Solution:**
1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Verify the Client ID
4. Click **"Reset Secret"** if needed (creates a new Client Secret)
5. Copy and re-enter in WordPress

### Can't Find OAuth Consent Screen

**Problem:** OAuth consent screen menu item doesn't appear.

**Solution:**
1. Ensure you've selected your project in the dropdown at the top
2. Try clearing your browser cache
3. Use an incognito window
4. Ensure you have proper permissions on the Google Cloud project

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Client Secret

- ✅ **DO** store it securely in your WordPress database (the plugin encrypts it)
- ✅ **DO** use HTTPS on your WordPress site
- ❌ **DON'T** commit it to version control (Git, etc.)
- ❌ **DON'T** share it publicly or in support forums
- ❌ **DON'T** hardcode it in theme files

### Rotate Credentials Regularly

If you suspect your credentials have been compromised:

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**
2. Click on your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Click **"Reset Secret"**
4. Update the new secret in WordPress

### Limit Scopes

The plugin only requests `calendar.readonly` scope (read-only access). Never grant more permissions than necessary.

### Monitor API Usage

1. Go to **APIs & Services** → **Dashboard**
2. View your Calendar API usage
3. Set up quotas and alerts if needed

## Publishing Your App (Optional)

By default, your app is in "Testing" mode with a limit of 100 users. If you need more users:

### When to Publish

- You have a public WordPress site with many visitors
- You expect more than 100 unique Google accounts to connect
- You want to remove the "unverified app" warning

### Steps to Publish

1. Go to **OAuth consent screen**
2. Review all information is correct
3. Click **"PUBLISH APP"**
4. If using sensitive scopes (like calendar.readonly), you'll need to submit for verification:
   - Fill out the verification questionnaire
   - Explain how your app uses Calendar data
   - Provide demo video
   - Google will review (can take several days to weeks)

### Verification Requirements

For most small sites, you **don't need to publish** the app. Just add test users as needed.
