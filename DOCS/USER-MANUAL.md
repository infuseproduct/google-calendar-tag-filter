## Administrator Guide

As an administrator, you'll set up the plugin so content editors can easily embed calendars.

### Initial Setup

#### Step 1: Access Plugin Settings

1. Log in to WordPress admin
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Calendar Filter**

#### Step 2: Connect to Google Calendar

1. **Get OAuth Credentials:**
   - Follow the [Google Cloud Console Setup Guide](SETUP-google-cloud-console.md)
   - You'll need:
     - Client ID
     - Client Secret

2. **Enter Credentials:**

   - Log in to your Google account
   - Authorize the plugin (read-only calendar access)
   - You'll be redirected back to WordPress

4. **Select Calendar:**
   - Choose which calendar to display from the dropdown
   - Click **"Save Calendar Selection"**

#### Step 3: Set Up Categories

Categories are tags you'll use to filter events. Think about how you want to organize your events.

**Example Categories:**
- `COMMUNITY` → "Community Events"
- `WORKSHOP` → "Workshops & Training"
- `MEETING` → "Board Meetings"
- `FUNDRAISER` → "Fundraising Events"
- `VOLUNTEER` → "Volunteer Opportunities"

**To Add a Category:**

1. Scroll to **"Category Whitelist"** section
2. Enter **Category ID:**
   - Must be UPPERCASE
   - Only letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens
   - Example: `COMMUNITY`
3. Enter **Display Name:**

   - Useful after making changes in Google Calendar

#### Step 5: Test Connection

   - ✅ Number of events found
3. If test fails, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)

### Managing the Plugin

## Content Editor Guide

As a content editor, you'll embed calendar views on pages and posts using shortcodes.

### Understanding Shortcodes

Shortcodes are simple text codes that display the calendar:

```
[gcal_embed view="calendar" period="month"]
```

### Shortcode Parameters

Every shortcode needs these parameters:

| Parameter | Required | Options | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `view` | ✅ Yes | `calendar` or `list` | How to display events |
| `period` | ✅ Yes | `week`, `month`, or `future` | Time range |
| `tags` | ❌ No | Category IDs (comma-separated) | Filter by categories |
| `show_categories` | ❌ No | `true` or `false` (default: `false`) | Show category filter sidebar |
| `show_display_style` | ❌ No | `true` or `false` (default: `false`) | Show view toggle (calendar/list) |

### Common Use Cases

#### Show All Events This Month (Calendar View)

```
[gcal_embed view="calendar" period="month"]
```

**Result:** Full calendar grid showing all events for the current month

---

#### Show Upcoming Community Events (List View)

```
[gcal_embed tags="COMMUNITY" view="list" period="future"]
```

**Result:** List of all future community events in chronological order

---

#### Show This Week's Workshops (Calendar View)

```
[gcal_embed tags="WORKSHOP" view="calendar" period="week"]
```

**Result:** 7-day calendar showing only workshop events

---

#### Show Multiple Categories (List View)

```
[gcal_embed tags="WORKSHOP,TRAINING,MEETING" view="list" period="month"]
```

**Result:** List of workshops, training, or meetings this month

---

#### Show Calendar with Category Sidebar

```
[gcal_embed view="calendar" period="month" show_categories="true"]
```

**Result:** Calendar with sidebar showing all categories. Visitors can click categories to filter events in real-time.

---

#### Show Calendar with View Toggle and Categories

```
[gcal_embed view="calendar" period="month" show_categories="true" show_display_style="true"]
```

**Result:** Calendar with sidebar containing:
- View toggle buttons (switch between calendar and list)
- Category filter buttons

This is the most interactive display option, perfect for main calendar pages.

---

#### Pre-filter with Interactive Categories

```
[gcal_embed tags="WORKSHOP" view="calendar" period="week" show_categories="true"]
```

**Result:** Calendar pre-filtered to workshops, but visitors can switch to other categories using the sidebar.

### How to Add a Shortcode

#### In Classic Editor:

1. Edit your page or post
2. Place cursor where you want the calendar
3. Type (or paste) the shortcode
4. Click **"Update"** or **"Publish"**

### Tips for Content Editors

✅ **DO:**
- Use descriptive tags to filter events
- Mix calendar and list views on different pages
- Test the shortcode after adding it

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use tags that aren't in the whitelist (they'll be ignored)
- Forget the required parameters (`view` and `period`)
- Use lowercase in tag names (always UPPERCASE)

## Calendar Manager Guide

As a calendar manager, you'll tag events in Google Calendar so they appear in filtered views.

### Tagging Events

Events are tagged by adding special codes to the event **description**.

#### Tag Format

```
[[[CATEGORY_ID]]]
```

**Example:**
```
[[[COMMUNITY]]]
```

**Note:** The simplified format no longer requires "TAG:" prefix.

### Single Tag Example

**Event:** Community Potluck Dinner

**How to Tag:**

1. Open the event in Google Calendar
2. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
3. In the **Description** field, add:
   ```
   [[[COMMUNITY]]]

   Join us for our monthly potluck dinner! Bring your favorite dish to share.

   What to bring:
   - Main dish, side, or dessert
   - Your own plate and utensils
   ```
4. Click **Save**

**Result:** This event will appear when filtering by `COMMUNITY` tag.

---

### Multiple Tags Example

**Event:** Volunteer Training Workshop

**How to Tag:**

1. Edit the event
2. Add multiple tags to the description:
   ```
   [[[VOLUNTEER]]][[[WORKSHOP]]][[[TRAINING]]]

   Learn how to become a volunteer at our organization. This workshop covers:
   - Volunteer roles and responsibilities
   - Safety procedures
   - Q&A with current volunteers

   Registration required.
   ```
3. Save the event

**Result:** This event appears when filtering by `VOLUNTEER`, `WORKSHOP`, or `TRAINING`.

---

### Tagging Best Practices

#### ✅ DO:

- **Add tags at the very beginning** of the description
- **Use multiple tags** if an event fits multiple categories
- **Check the whitelist** - only use approved category IDs
- **Keep tags together** - don't spread them throughout the description
- **Write description text after tags** - users won't see the tag codes

#### ❌ DON'T:

- Don't use lowercase: `[[[community]]]` ❌ (won't work)
- Don't add spaces: `[[[COMMUNITY ]]]` ❌ (won't work)
- Don't misspell: `[[[COMUNITY]]]` ❌ (won't be recognized)
- Don't use non-whitelisted tags (they'll be ignored)
- Don't use old format: `[[[TAG:COMMUNITY]]]` ❌ (outdated format)

### What Happens to Tags

**Important:** Tags are **invisible to website visitors**. The plugin:
1. ✅ Reads tags from descriptions
2. ✅ Uses them to filter events
3. ✅ **Removes tags** before displaying descriptions
4. ✅ Shows only your actual event description

### Tag Examples by Category

#### Community Events
```
[[[COMMUNITY]]]

Monthly neighborhood meetup. Light refreshments provided.
```

#### Workshops
```
[[[WORKSHOP]]]

Hands-on coding workshop. Bring your laptop. All skill levels welcome.
```

#### Board Meetings
```
[[[MEETING]]]

Monthly board meeting. Members only. Agenda will be sent via email.
```

#### Fundraisers
```
[[[FUNDRAISER]]][[[COMMUNITY]]]

Annual gala dinner to support our programs. Tickets: $50/person
```

### Checking Your Tags

After tagging events:

1. View the calendar on your website
2. Use different tag filters in shortcodes
3. Verify events appear in the correct filtered views
4. Check that tag codes don't appear in event descriptions

---

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing Up

**Problem:** Calendar or list is empty

**Possible Causes:**

1. **No events match the filter**
   - Check if events have the correct tags
   - Try viewing without tags: `[gcal_embed view="list" period="month"]`

2. **Tags aren't recognized**
   - Verify tag format: `[[[CATEGORYID]]]`
   - Check category is in whitelist (WordPress admin)
   - Ensure UPPERCASE
   - Don't use old format with "TAG:" prefix

3. **Cache is stale**
   - Clear cache in plugin settings
   - Wait for cache to expire (default: 1 minute)

4. **Calendar not connected**
   - Check connection in Settings → Calendar Filter
   - Test connection
   - Reconnect if needed

### Tags Visible to Users

**Problem:** Tags like `[[[COMMUNITY]]]` appear in event descriptions

**Cause:** Tag format is incorrect

**Solution:**
- Must be exactly: `[[[CATEGORYID]]]`
- Three opening brackets, three closing brackets
- All UPPERCASE
- No spaces
- No "TAG:" prefix (simplified format)

### Connection Errors

**Problem:** "Not authenticated" or "Connection failed"

**Solutions:**

1. **OAuth expired:**
   - Go to Settings → Calendar Filter
   - Click "Disconnect"
   - Reconnect following setup steps

2. **Wrong credentials:**
   - Verify Client ID and Secret in Google Cloud Console
   - Re-enter in WordPress
   - Ensure no extra spaces

3. **Redirect URI mismatch:**
   - Check redirect URI in WordPress matches Google Cloud Console exactly
   - See [Google Cloud Setup Guide](SETUP-google-cloud-console.md)

### Timezone Issues

**Problem:** Event times showing in wrong timezone

**This is normal!** The plugin displays times in each visitor's browser timezone automatically, formatted in French (24-hour format).

- Event stored in Google Calendar: 2:00 PM PST (14:00)
- Visitor in EST sees: 17:00 (5:00 PM EST)
- Visitor in PST sees: 14:00 (2:00 PM PST)
- Dates show in French: "9 novembre 2025 à 17:00"

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Calendar loads slowly

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase cache duration:**
   - Go to Settings → Calendar Filter
   - Set cache to 5-10 minutes

2. **Limit events:**
   - Use specific periods (`week` or `month` instead of `future`)
   - Use tag filters to reduce event count

3. **Check API quota:**
   - Log in to Google Cloud Console
   - Check Calendar API usage
   - Ensure you haven't hit rate limits
