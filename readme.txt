= Perfect For =

* Churches and religious organizations
* Community centers and non-profits
* Schools and educational institutions
* Businesses with public events
* Coworking spaces and meetup groups
* Any organization managing categorized events

= How It Works =

1. Connect your Google Calendar using OAuth 2.0
2. Tag your Google Calendar events with category identifiers in the description (e.g., `[[[WORKSHOP]]]`)
3. Configure your category whitelist with custom colors
4. Embed events on any page using the `[gcal_embed]` shortcode
5. Users can filter events by category, view, and time period

= Shortcode Examples =

Display current year in calendar view:
`[gcal_embed view="calendar" period="year"]`

Show upcoming workshops with category filter:
`[gcal_embed tags="WORKSHOP" view="list" period="year" show_categories="true"]`

Show all future events:
`[gcal_embed view="list" period="future"]`

Use wildcard matching:
`[gcal_embed view="list" tags="WORKSHOP*" period="future"]`

= Privacy & Security =

* OAuth tokens are encrypted before storage
* All input is sanitized and validated
* Output is properly escaped to prevent XSS
* Nonce verification for all admin actions
* Read-only calendar access - the plugin cannot modify your Google Calendar

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a Google Cloud account? =

Yes, you need to create OAuth 2.0 credentials in Google Cloud Console. This ensures secure, authorized access to your calendar. The plugin provides step-by-step instructions.

= Can the plugin modify my Google Calendar? =

No, the plugin requests read-only access to your calendar. It can only display events, not create, edit, or delete them.

= How do I tag events for filtering? =

Add tags to your event descriptions in Google Calendar using the format `[[[CATEGORY_ID]]]`. Tags are automatically stripped from the displayed description.

= What happens if I exceed Google's API quota? =

The plugin includes smart caching to minimize API calls. If you hit rate limits, increase the cache duration in settings (we recommend 5-10 minutes for high-traffic sites).

= Does it work with multiple calendars? =

Currently, the plugin displays events from one selected calendar. You can change which calendar to display in the settings.

= Is HTTPS required? =

HTTPS is required for production sites (OAuth 2.0 requirement). HTTP is allowed for localhost development.

Yes! The plugin uses clean CSS that can be overridden in your theme. All markup uses BEM methodology for easy targeting.

Yes, the plugin fully supports Google Calendar's recurring events and will display all instances within the selected time period.

= What about performance? =

The plugin includes smart caching (default 1 minute, configurable up to 60 minutes) and AJAX navigation to minimize server load and provide a fast user experience.
